# Dhiren Kakkar - Data Science Roadmap


## About

Made this repository to track my progress in data science and machine learning. Hopefully It'll be a good tool to organise my goals, develop more holistic projects and provide a clear learning roadmap. I'll try to update it regularly :)

*many concepts were directly applied while learning them or working on personal project (repo are linked in the tools/library section)
